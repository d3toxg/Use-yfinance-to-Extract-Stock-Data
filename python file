Using the yfinance Library to Extract Stock Data
Using the Ticker module we can create an object that will allow us to access functions to extract data. 
To do this we need to provide the ticker symbol for the stock, here the company is Apple and the ticker symbol is AAPL.

apple = yf.Ticker("AAPL")

Now we can access functions and variables to extract the type of data we need.
You can view them and what they represent here https://aroussi.com/post/python-yahoo-finance.

Stock Info

Using the attribute info we can extract information about the stock as a Python dictionary.

apple_info=apple.info
apple_info

apple_info['country']

Extracting Share Price
apple_share_price_data = apple.history(period="max")

apple_share_price_data.head()

apple_share_price_data.reset_index(inplace=True)

apple_share_price_data.plot(x="Date", y="Open")

apple.dividends

apple.dividends.plot()
